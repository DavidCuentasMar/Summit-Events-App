# Second Generation Packaging Summit Events

## sfdx-project.json

The sfdx-project.json is the control center for package versioning and ancestry.

**versionNumber**: This is in major.minor.patch.build format. The NEXT just ups the 
build number on beta release builds until the package is promoted. 

**ancestorId**: This is the latest id of the release package you want to inherit 
ancestry from. This ***is not*** the id of first ever released package, but most 
often the id of the last package you created. For upgradeability the last package 
will follow its ancestor, and so on until the original release package id is found (if ancestry 
has not been broken at some point). All packages in this chain of ancestors can be 
updated to the current package you are creating.

## Build a beta package

It is surprisingly simple to build a beta package:

```shell script
sfdx force:package:version:create --path force-app --codecoverage --installationkeybypass --wait 10
```
**--codecoverage**: Will run tests for code coverage during packaging.

**--installationkeybypass**: will eliminate the need for a key for installation by end users. 

Packaging seems to take about 10-15 minutes. Occasionally it will time out but give commands
to check on the build in the future.

## Promote a beta package

In order for a beta package to come out of beta to be a fully released version you need 
to promote the beta version with the following command:

```shell script
sfdx force:package:version:promote -p version_01_id -n
```

**version_01_id**: replace this with the beta version you wish to promote. 
You can consult the sfdx-project.json to see what version that might be as it updates
during beta package creation.

Promoted packages will use the same URL as the beta package. It may take several
minutes before the package will appear to not be in beta. If you followed the
installation URL and it still says that the package is beta wait on it until the beta
flag is removed. Simply refresh the package installation page until it no longer 
says beta.


## Installing a package

At the end of packaging you will get a URL to install the package. It will look like
this with the ***version_01_id*** replaced with the package id. Don't install beta packages 
in production orgs.
