    <fullName>reCAPTCHA_v3_Score__c</fullName>
    <description>A score between 0 and 1 (.1, .2. .3, etc). Zero  is the most suspect client and 1 is the least. If you set your score to zero all traffic will be permitted (even the most suspect). If you set your score to 1 only the most pristine traffic will be allowed (very rare that a client would score a 1 so most traffic would be blocked).</description>
